## ⚡ Why this fork exists

This is the Baileys build that runs the Violetics bot fleet: roughly 125 WhatsApp sessions inside
one Node process. Everything in the table below came out of that, and most of it is invisible until
you run more than a handful of sockets at once — a bug that costs one session a reconnect costs a
fleet an hour of flapping.

| Change | What it fixes |
| --- | --- |
| **Disconnect reasons are named** | `CB:failure` closed with the constant message `Connection Failure` for a 401 device-removal and for a transient 503 alike. A host that re-emits the close as its own `error` event forwards `message` and nothing else, so it could not tell a dead session from a blip and reconnected both — one logout became a re-auth loop and the number got banned. `end()` now appends the code and its `DisconnectReason`: `Connection Failure [401 loggedOut]`. |
| **Retry caches are bounded** | `sessionRecreateHistory` and `retryCounters` had a TTL but no `max`, and one `MessageRetryManager` exists per socket. `retryCounters` sets `updateAgeOnGet`, so a message stuck in a retry loop refreshed its own expiry indefinitely — the opposite of what a TTL backstop is for. |
| **Keepalive is per socket, and staggered** | A single process-wide 30s timer pinged every socket in the same tick, while the staleness check used the configured interval — so any `keepAliveIntervalMs` other than 30000 produced false `connectionLost` closes. Each socket now owns its timer and starts on a random offset. |
| **Housekeeping is not gated on presence** | The 24-hour `tcTokenKnownJids` prune only ran while `isOnline` was true, and `isOnline` is only ever set by `sendPresenceUpdate`. A bot that never marks itself online never pruned anything. |
| **One failing socket cannot take the host down** | A socket that failed to open, and an unhandled rejection out of `end()` mid-teardown, killed the whole process — and with it every other session sharing it. |
| **Signal keys flush on close** | Key writes are debounced and nothing called flush on close, so every ratchet advance from the last window was dropped and the next connection decrypted against stale state. |
| **The offline queue drains fully** | Baileys asked for one `offline_batch` of 100 stanzas and never asked for another, so a larger backlog stayed on the server and grew on every reconnect. |

Upstream feature work — newsletter media, interactive messages, albums, the MEX and HTTPS GraphQL
surface — is listed under [Upstream Fixes & Improvements](#%EF%B8%8F-upstream-fixes--improvements)

## 🛠️ Upstream Fixes & Improvements

- 🖼️ Fixed an issue where media could not be sent to newsletters due to an upstream issue.
- 📁 Reintroduced [`makeInMemoryStore`](#%EF%B8%8F-implementing-data-store) with a minimal ESM adaptation and small adjustments for Baileys v7.
- 📦 Switched FFmpeg execution from `exec` to `spawn` for safer process handling.
- 🗃️ Added [`@napi-rs/image`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@napi-rs/image) as a supported image processing backend in [`getImageProcessingLibrary()`](#%EF%B8%8F-image-processing), offering a balance between performance and compatibility.
- 🪪 Recovered the phone number for LID-addressed senders that arrive without one, so [username](#-username-management) users no longer show up as a bare `@lid`.- 📞 Routed top-level call stanzas (`<offer>`, `<terminate>`, …) that arrive outside a `<call>` wrapper, and acknowledged them — previously they were never acked, so the server kept redelivering them.- 🤖 Decrypted `msmsg` Meta AI bot replies instead of dropping them. The `messageSecret` is captured at send time and recovered from `getMessage` after a restart.- 🔍 Parsed the USync fields that were previously left as TODOs: per-protocol errors with backoff, cache `refresh` hints, `side_list`, per-contact privacy tokens, and blocked-by-contact detection.- 🆔 Fixed the USync username parser, which returned `null` for the `Uint8Array` payloads the binary decoder actually produces.- 📥 Drained the whole offline queue on reconnect. Baileys requested a single `offline_batch` of 100 stanzas and never asked for another, so any larger backlog stayed on the server and grew on every reconnect.- 📣 Fanned out sends to broadcast lists (`<id>@broadcast`) over a sender key, using the same `statusJidList` option as status posts for the recipient list.- 🔑 Surfaced `keyRequired` from `onWhatsAppUsername()` when the server withholds the account until the 4-digit username key is supplied; previously such rows were dropped.- 🔔 Emitted `username.update` (a contact set or removed their `@username`), `lid-mapping.update` (a contact's LID rotated; the known phone number is carried over), and `privacy.update` (privacy settings changed on the phone) from server notifications.- 🙈 Skipped placeholder resend requests for `<unavailable/>` messages WhatsApp marks as unrecoverable (`<bot/>`, `hosted="true"`, `type="view_once"`); the previous check compared against attribute values the server never sends.- 🪪 Recognised own LID / hosted devices as `fromMe` in status posts and group notifications, and read `remoteJidUsername` from the `username` attribute on 1:1 messages.- 📌 Requested `fetch_pinned_messages` on `newsletterMetadata()`, so pinned posts come back with the metadata.- 🎞️ Attached the `streamingSidecar` WhatsApp Web sends with video and audio uploads, so recipients can seek and play while downloading. Skipped for mp4 files that are not faststart (`mdat` before `moov`), where a sidecar would make playback fail instead of falling back to a plain download.- 🕒 Stamped `disappearingMode` (and `ephemeralSettingTimestamp` when passed via `sendMessage` options) on ephemeral messages, matching WhatsApp Web; without it the peer warns the message will not disappear.- 🗳️ Added `decryptPollVoteWithFallback()` / `decryptEventResponseWithFallback()`, which try the poll or event creator's PN and LID forms; voters encrypt with whichever form of the creator JID they hold. Event responses now use it internally.- 🆔 Username lookups (`onWhatsAppUsername()`) request LID addressing, as WhatsApp Web does; `USyncQuery.withContactProtocol('lid' | 'pn')` exposes the switch.- 🗳️ Poll votes are decrypted again inside `processMessage` and surfaced as `pollUpdates` on `messages.update` (like Baileys v6.4 did), trying the creator's PN and LID forms. Requires `getMessage` to return the poll creation message.- 🧾 `hideVoter` / `canAddOption` polls go out as `pollCreationMessageV6`, the only version that carries those flags.- 🧠 History sync chunks are decoded one conversation at a time instead of materialising the whole `HistorySync` tree, cutting peak memory on large syncs. Output is byte-identical to the previous path.- 🔢 `version` accepts a resolver function, and a `405 client_too_old` failure fetches the live WA Web build and applies it on the next reconnect. `fetchLatestWaWebVersion()` now times out after 10s (`timeoutMs` / `signal` options).- 🔐 Passkey-gated (Shortcake) accounts are surfaced: `connection.update { passkeyRequired: true }` plus a warning when the server sends `passkey_prologue_request`. Expired pairing codes (`refresh_code`) are re-registered automatically with the same code, or surfaced as `connection.update { pairingCodeExpired: true }`.- 🏢 `onWhatsAppUsername()` also reports `isBusiness` / `pnJid`; the USync business parser treats a `<error/>` child as "not a business" instead of failing the whole query, and `withBusinessProtocol(null)` asks for the verified name only.
## 📨 Messages Handling & Compatibility

- 📩 Expanded messages support for:
  - 🖼️ [Album Message](#%EF%B8%8F-album-image--video)
  - 👤 [Group Status Message](#%E2%80%8D%E2%80%8D-group-status)
  - 👉🏻 [Interactive Message](#-sending-interactive-messages) (buttons, lists, native flows, templates, carousels).
  - 🎞️ [Status Mention Message](#%EF%B8%8F-status-mention)
  - 📦 [Sticker Pack Message](#-sticker-pack)
  - ✨ [Rich Response Message](#-rich-response)  - 🧾 [Message with Code Blocks](#-message-with-code-block)  - 🌏 [Message with Inline Entities](#-message-with-inline-entities)  - 📋 [Message with Table](#-message-with-table)  - 💳 [Payment-related Message](#-sending-payment-messages) (payment requests, invites, orders, invoices).
- 📰 Simplified sending messages with ad thumbnail using [`externalAdReply`](#-external-ad-reply), without requiring manual `contextInfo`.
- 💭 Added support for quoting messages inside channel (newsletter).- 🎀 Added support for [custom button icon](#%EF%B8%8F-interactive).

> [!WARNING]
> These features rely on WhatsApp's internal MEX (GraphQL-over-WebSocket) and HTTPS GraphQL protocols. The numeric query IDs were captured from a specific WhatsApp client version and **may stop working after a WhatsApp update** — a rejected query usually means the ID is stale, not that the code is broken.

## 📥 Installation

Node.js 20 or newer. The package is ESM; see the CJS note below.

```bash
# from npm
npm i @violetix/baileys

# or straight from the repository, to track main ahead of a release
npm i github:cv3inx/bv2
```

Equivalent `package.json` entries — one or the other, not both:

```json
{
   "dependencies": {
      "@violetix/baileys": "^0.3.18"
   }
}
```

```json
{
   "dependencies": {
      "@violetix/baileys": "github:cv3inx/bv2"
   }
}
```

### 🧩 Import (ESM & CJS)

```javascript
// --- ESM
import { makeWASocket } from "@violetix/baileys";

// --- CJS (tested and working on Node.js 24 ✅)
const { makeWASocket } = require("@violetix/baileys");
```

## 🌐 Connect to WhatsApp (Quick Step)

```javascript
import { makeWASocket, delay, DisconnectReason, useMultiFileAuthState } from '@violetix/baileys'
import { Boom } from '@hapi/boom'
import pino from 'pino'

// --- Connect with pairing code
const myPhoneNumber = '6288888888888'

const logger = pino({ level: 'silent' })

const connectToWhatsApp = async () => {
   const { state, saveCreds } = await useMultiFileAuthState('session')

   const sock = makeWASocket({
      logger,
      auth: state,
      // optional: always connect with the live WhatsApp Web build. A stale hardcoded
      // version is rejected (405 client_too_old, or 400 at pair-device); the socket also
      // fetches the latest one by itself after a 405 and uses it on the next reconnect.
      version: async () => (await fetchLatestWaWebVersion({})).version
   })

   sock.ev.on('creds.update', saveCreds)

   sock.ev.on('connection.update', (update) => {
      const { connection, lastDisconnect } = update
      if (connection === 'connecting' && !sock.authState.creds.registered) {
         await delay(1500)
         const code = await sock.requestPairingCode(myPhoneNumber)
         console.log('🔗 Pairing code', ':', code)
      }
      else if (connection === 'close') {
         const shouldReconnect = new Boom(connection?.lastDisconnect?.error)?.output?.statusCode !== DisconnectReason.loggedOut
         console.log('⚠️ Connection closed because', lastDisconnect.error, ', reconnecting ', shouldReconnect)
         if (shouldReconnect) {
            connectToWhatsApp()
         }
      }
      else if (connection === 'open') {
         console.log('✅ Successfully connected to WhatsApp')
      }
   })

   sock.ev.on('messages.upsert', async ({ messages }) => {
      for (const message of messages) {
         if (!message.message) continue

         console.log('🔔 Got new message', ':', message)
         await sock.sendMessage(message.key.remoteJid, {
            text: '👋🏻 Hello world'
         })
      }
   })
}

connectToWhatsApp()
```

### 🔐 Auth State

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the experimental `useSingleFileAuthState` and `useSqliteAuthState` as an alternative to `useMultiFileAuthState`. However, `useSingleFileAuthState` already includes an internal caching mechanism, so there is no need to wrap `state.keys` with `makeCacheableSignalKeyStore`.

## 🗄️ Implementing Data Store

> [!CAUTION]
> I highly recommend building your own data store, as keeping an entire chat history in memory can lead to excessive RAM usage.

```javascript
import { makeWASocket, makeInMemoryStore, delay, DisconnectReason, useMultiFileAuthState } from '@violetix/baileys'
import { Boom } from '@hapi/boom'
import pino from 'pino'

const myPhoneNumber = '6288888888888'

// --- Create your store path
const storePath = './store.json'

const logger = pino({ level: 'silent' })

const connectToWhatsApp = async () => {
   const { state, saveCreds } = await useMultiFileAuthState('session')

   const sock = makeWASocket({
      logger,
      auth: state
   })

   const store = makeInMemoryStore({
      logger,
      socket: sock
   })

   store.bind(sock.ev)

   sock.ev.on('creds.update', saveCreds)

   sock.ev.on('connection.update', (update) => {
      const { connection, lastDisconnect } = update
      if (connection === 'connecting' && !sock.authState.creds.registered) {
         await delay(1500)
         const code = await sock.requestPairingCode(myPhoneNumber)
         console.log('🔗 Pairing code', ':', code)
      }
      else if (connection === 'close') {
         const shouldReconnect = new Boom(connection?.lastDisconnect?.error)?.output?.statusCode !== DisconnectReason.loggedOut
         console.log('⚠️ Connection closed because', lastDisconnect.error, ', reconnecting ', shouldReconnect)
         if (shouldReconnect) {
            connectToWhatsApp()
         }
      }
      else if (connection === 'open') {
         console.log('✅ Successfully connected to WhatsApp')
      }
   })

   sock.ev.on('chats.upsert', () => {
      console.log('✉️ Got chats', store.chats.all())
   })

   sock.ev.on('contacts.upsert', () => {
      console.log('👥 Got contacts', Object.values(store.contacts))
   })

   // --- Read store from file
   store.readFromFile(storePath)

   // --- Save store every 3 minutes
   setInterval(() => {
      store.writeToFile(storePath)
   }, 180000)
}

connectToWhatsApp()
```

## 🪪 WhatsApp IDs Explain

`id` is the WhatsApp ID, called `jid` and `lid` too, of the person or group you're sending the message to.

- It must be in the format `[country code][phone number]@s.whatsapp.net`
  - Example for people: `19999999999@s.whatsapp.net` and `12699999999@lid`.
  - For groups, it must be in the format `123456789-123345@g.us`.
- For Meta AI, it's `11111111111@bot`.
- For broadcast lists, it's `[timestamp of creation]@broadcast`.
- For stories, the ID is `status@broadcast`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Senders who set a WhatsApp [username](#-username-management) arrive LID-addressed, and WhatsApp sends **no** phone number alongside them. This fork recovers the phone number from the local LID↔PN mapping and fills in `key.remoteJidAlt` (or `key.participantAlt` in groups).>
> That recovery only works once a mapping exists — from history sync, group metadata, or an earlier chat. On a first-ever contact from a username user there is genuinely no phone number to recover, so **handle `@lid` natively** rather than assuming a phone number is always available.

## ✉️ Sending Messages

> [!NOTE]
> You can get the `jid` from `message.key.remoteJid` in the first example.

### 🔠 Text

```javascript
// --- Send a regular text message
sock.sendMessage(
  jid,
  {
    text: "👋🏻 Hello",
  },
  {
    quoted: message,
  },
);

// --- Send a text message with a link preview
const urlA = "https://www.npmjs.com/package/@violetix/baileys";

sock.sendMessage(jid, {
  text: urlA + " 👆🏻 Check it out!",
  linkPreview: {
    "matched-text": urlA,
    title: "🌱 @violetix/baileys",
    description: "Underrated Baileys Fork",
    previewType: 0, // --- Use 1 for video playback in the link preview
    jpegThumbnail: fs.readFileSync("./path/to/image.jpg"),
  },
});

// --- Send a text message with a large link preview and favicon
import { prepareWAMessageMedia } from "@violetix/baileys";

const urlB = "https://www.npmjs.com/package/@violetix/baileys#readme";

const { imageMessage: image } = await prepareWAMessageMedia(

### ✨ Rich Response

> [!NOTE]
> `richResponse[]` is a representation of [`submessages[]`](https://baileys.wiki/docs/api/namespaces/proto/interfaces/IAIRichResponseSubMessage) inside `richResponseMessage`.

> [!TIP]
> You can still use the original [`submessages[]`](https://baileys.wiki/docs/api/namespaces/proto/interfaces/IAIRichResponseSubMessage) field directly.
> The code example below is just an implementation using a helper, not a required structure.

```javascript
sock.sendMessage(jid, {
  disclaimerText: "RAW submessages structure example",
  richResponse: [
    {
      text: "Example Usage",
    },
    {
      language: "javascript",
      code: [
        {
          highlightType: 0,
          codeContent: 'console.log("Hello, World!")',
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      text: "Pretty simple, right?\n",
    },
    {
      text: "Comparison between Node.js, Bun, and Deno",
    },
    {
      title: "Runtime Comparison",
      table: [
        {
          isHeading: true,
          items: ["", "Node.js", "Bun", "Deno"],
        },
        {
          isHeading: false,
          items: ["Engine", "V8 (C++)", "JavaScriptCore (C++)", "V8 (C++)"],
        },
        {
          isHeading: false,
          items: ["Performance", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5"],
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      text: "Does this help clarify the differences?",
    },
  ],
});
```

> [!TIP]
> You can easily add syntax highlighting by importing `tokenizeCode` directly from Baileys.

```javascript
import { tokenizeCode } from "@violetix/baileys";

const language = "javascript";
const code = 'console.log("Hello, World!")';

sock.sendMessage(jid, {
  disclaimerText: "Example of tokenizing Code Block",
  richResponse: [
    {
      text: "Example Usage",
    },
    {
      language,
      code: tokenizeCode(code, language),
    },
    {
      text: "Pretty simple, right?",
    },
  ],
});
```

> 💡 Supported Languages: `css`, `html`, `javascript`, `typescript`, `python`, `golang`, `rust`, `c`, `c#`, `c++`, `bash`, `bat`, `powershell`.

> MEX feature and setting values are lowercase and case-sensitive on the wire.
>
> Features: `last`, `online`, `profile`, `status`, `readreceipts`, `groupadd`, `groupcreation`, `calladd`, `defense`.
> Settings: `all`, `contacts`, `contact_blacklist`, `none` — except `online` (`all` | `match_last_seen`), `calladd` (`all` | `contacts` | `known`), and `defense` (`off` | `on_standard`).

```javascript
// --- Read every privacy setting for your own account
const settings = await sock.getPrivacySettings(sock.user.id);

// --- Change a privacy setting
await sock.setPrivacySetting("last", "contacts");
await sock.setPrivacySetting("defense", "on_standard");

// --- Manage the allow/deny list attached to a setting
await sock.getPrivacyContactList("groupadd", "contact_blacklist");
await sock.updatePrivacyContactList("groupadd", "contact_blacklist", [
  "6281111111111@s.whatsapp.net",
]);

// --- About text (your own, and other people's)
await sock.updateTextStatus("Available for chats 👋");
const abouts = await sock.getTextStatusList(["6281111111111@s.whatsapp.net"]);

// --- Only return About texts newer than a timestamp
await sock.getTextStatusList(jids, Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

// --- Verify a JID is reachable before opening a chat
const check = await sock.contactIntegrityQuery([
  "6281111111111@s.whatsapp.net",
]);
const bizCheck = await sock.bizIntegrityQuery(["6281111111111@s.whatsapp.net"]);

// --- Profile picture
const info = await sock.fetchUserPictureInfo("6281111111111@s.whatsapp.net");
await sock.setProfilePictureMex(imageBase64, "image"); // full resolution
await sock.setProfilePictureMex(imageBase64, "preview"); // thumbnail

// --- Linked social profiles (FB & IG)
await sock.linkedProfilesSet([{ type: "IG", username: "someone" }]);
await sock.linkedProfilesUpdate([{ type: "IG", showOnProfile: true }]);
await sock.linkedProfilesRemove(["IG"]);

// --- Trusted devices
const devices = await sock.getTrustedDevices();
await sock.addTrustedDevice(deviceId, "My Laptop");
await sock.untrustTrustedDevice(deviceId);
await sock.deleteTrustedDevice(deviceId);

// --- Misc
await sock.fetchMobileConfig();
await sock.migrateBlocklistLid(["6281111111111@s.whatsapp.net"]);

// --- Raw query IDs, if you need to build a query yourself
sock.PRIVACY_MEX_IDS;
```

### 🆔 Username Management

WhatsApp usernames (`@username`) let people be found without sharing a phone number.
> [!NOTE]
> Usernames are looked up over USync, while your own username is managed over MEX. Pass the username **without** the leading `@` — a leading `@` is stripped for you.

```javascript
// --- Look up accounts by username
const results = await sock.onWhatsAppUsername("someusername");

console.log("🆔 Got user", ":", results);

// --- Output
// [
//    {
//       username: 'someusername',
//       jid: '43411111111111@lid',
//       exists: true
//    }
// ]

// --- Look up several at once, with a PIN for protected usernames
await sock.onWhatsAppUsername("someusername", {
  username: "protectedname",
  usernameKey: "1234",
});

// --- Fetch the username of one or more JIDs
const usernames = await sock.fetchUsername("6281111111111@s.whatsapp.net");

console.log("🆔 Got username", ":", usernames);

// --- Output
// [
//    {
//       jid: '6281111111111@s.whatsapp.net',
//       username: 'someusername'
//    }
// ]
// --- username is undefined when the account has none set
```

Managing your own username is a two-step flow — check availability first, then claim it with the `session_id` returned by the check.

```javascript
// --- Step 1: check availability
const check = await sock.checkUsername("myusername");

if (!check.available) {
  console.log("🆔 Taken. Try", ":", check.suggestions);
  console.log("🆔 Rejected because", ":", check.rejectionReasons);
  return;
}

// --- Step 2: claim it, reusing the session_id from the check
await sock.setUsername("myusername", {
  sessionId: check.session_id,
});

// --- Claim one of the server's suggestions
await sock.setUsername(check.suggestions[0], {
  source: "SUGGESTION",
  sessionId: check.session_id,
});

// --- Claim with a PIN protecting it
await sock.setUsername("myusername", {
  pin: "1234",
});

// --- Read your own username
const mine = await sock.getMyUsername();

// --- Change or remove the PIN
await sock.setUsernamePin("1234");
await sock.setUsernamePin(null);

// --- Remove your username entirely
await sock.deleteUsername();
```

### 🔍 USync Queries

USync fetches user data in bulk. Chain the protocols you need onto a single query.
```javascript
import { USyncQuery, USyncUser } from "@violetix/baileys";

// --- Business profile, profile picture, and About text in one round trip
const query = new USyncQuery()
  .withBusinessProtocol()
  .withPictureProtocol("preview")
  .withTextStatusProtocol()
  .withUser(new USyncUser().withId("6281111111111@s.whatsapp.net"));

const result = await sock.executeUSyncQuery(query);

console.log("🔍 Got data", ":", result.list);

// --- Device feature flags
const features = new USyncQuery()
  .withFeatureProtocol(["voip", "encrypt_v2"])
  .withUser(new USyncUser().withId("6281111111111@s.whatsapp.net"));

await sock.executeUSyncQuery(features);
```

| Protocol                                  | Returns                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `withBusinessProtocol(profileVersion?)`   | Verified name and level, business hours, address, catalog and cart flags    |
| `withPictureProtocol(type?)`              | Picture `id`, `directPath`, and `hash` — `'image'` (default) or `'preview'` |
| `withTextStatusProtocol()`                | About `text`, `emoji`, `setAt`, and `expiresAt`                             |
| `withSidelistProtocol(useLidAddressing?)` | Side-list entries, returned in `result.sideList`                            |
| `withFeatureProtocol(features?)`          | Device feature flags — defaults to all known features                       |

The query result also carries per-protocol diagnostics:

```javascript
const result = await sock.executeUSyncQuery(query);

result.list; // matched users
result.sideList; // side-list users, when the sidelist protocol was requested
result.errors; // { [protocol]: { errorCode, errorText, errorBackoff } }
result.refresh; // { [protocol]: seconds } — how long the response stays cacheable

// A contact who blocked you is flagged instead of throwing
result.list[0].isBlockedByContact;
```

> [!TIP]
> When `result.errors` carries an `errorBackoff`, wait at least that many seconds before repeating the same protocol — otherwise the server keeps rejecting it.

### 🤝 Interoperability (BirdyChat & Haiket)

Chat with users on third-party platforms that WhatsApp has opened up to.
```javascript
// --- List the integrators the server offers
const integrators = await sock.fetchIntegrators();

console.log("🤝 Got integrators", ":", integrators);

// --- Opt in (accepts the interop TOS and opts in, in one call)
await sock.initInterop();

// --- Or opt in and out manually
await sock.acceptInteropTOS();
await sock.optInIntegrators([sock.INTEGRATOR_BIRDYCHAT]);
await sock.optOutIntegrators([sock.INTEGRATOR_HAIKET]);

// --- Resolve an interop identifier into a JID
const user = await sock.resolveInteropUser("someone@example.com");
const users = await sock.resolveInteropUsers(["6281111111111"]);

// --- Interop groups
await sock.createInteropGroup(subject, participants);
await sock.addParticipantsToInteropGroup(groupJid, participants);
await sock.queryInteropGroupInfo(groupJid);
await sock.leaveInteropGroup(groupJid);

// --- Moderation & privacy
await sock.blockInteropUser(jid);
await sock.unblockInteropUser(jid);
await sock.reportInteropSpam(jid);
await sock.trustInteropContact(jid);
await sock.getReachabilitySettings();
await sock.queryInteropPrivacySettings();
await sock.updateInteropPrivacySetting(feature, setting);

// --- Force a fresh Signal session on the next send
await sock.resetInteropSession(jid);
```

> [!NOTE]
> `INTEGRATOR_BIRDYCHAT` identifies users by email, `INTEGRATOR_HAIKET` by phone number.

### 🔒 Account Security (Password & Passkey)

Account-level password and passkey (FIDO2 / WebAuthn) management.
> [!CAUTION]
> These change the security settings of the WhatsApp account itself, not just this session. Losing a password or passkey you set here can lock you out of the account.

```javascript
// --- Password
const { has_password } = await sock.hasPassword();
await sock.setPassword("my-secure-password");
await sock.setPassword("new-password", "old-password");
await sock.checkPassword("my-secure-password");
await sock.deletePassword("my-secure-password");

// --- Passkey
const exists = await sock.passkeyExists();
const list = await sock.passkeyListExists();
const challenge = await sock.passkeyRequestChallenge();
await sock.passkeyVerifyChallenge(
  credentialId,
  authenticatorData,
  clientDataJson,
  signature,
);
await sock.passkeyDelete(credentialId);

// --- Contacts backup
await sock.contactsUpload(contacts);
await sock.contactsBackup(contacts);
await sock.contactsBackupQuery();
await sock.selfContactsQuery();

// --- Misc account
await sock.getWaMeLink();
await sock.userCountryCodeGet();
await sock.removeAccountReachoutTimelock();
await sock.fetchUserNoticesById(noticeIds);

// --- Raw query IDs
sock.REGISTRATION_MEX_IDS;
```

### 👪 Managed Accounts & Payments

Parental / family account linking, payments passkey, and UPI onboarding.
```javascript
// --- Managed (supervised) accounts
await sock.managedAccountQuery(jid);
await sock.managedAccountInitiateLinking("6281111111111");
await sock.managedAccountValidateLinking(linkingToken, sponsorJid);
await sock.managedAccountAcceptLinking(linkingToken);
await sock.managedAccountCompleteLinking(linkingToken);
await sock.managedAccountRevokeLinking(sponsoredJid);
await sock.managedAccountSyncActivities(jid);
await sock.managedAccountUpdatePin(pin);

// --- Payments passkey
await sock.paymentsPasskeyHasCredential();
await sock.paymentsPasskeyEnrollChallenge();
await sock.paymentsPasskeyEnrollVerify(credential);
await sock.paymentsPasskeyToggleOn();
await sock.paymentsPasskeyToggleOff();
await sock.paymentsIsAccountRecoverable();

// --- UPI onboarding (India)
await sock.upiSendOtp(phoneNumber);
await sock.upiVerifyOtp(phoneNumber, otp);

// --- Raw query IDs
sock.MANAGED_ACCOUNT_MEX_IDS;
```

### 🌐 HTTPS GraphQL (Meta AI & Imagine)

Meta AI, Imagine, events, and payments run over HTTPS GraphQL rather than the WebSocket.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> These calls need an ACS access token. `acquireAccessToken()` fetches one for you on the first call (nonce → exchange) and caches it, so you normally do not have to do anything. Pass your own with `setAccessToken()` if you already have one.

```javascript
// --- Token handling (optional — acquired on demand otherwise)
await sock.acquireAccessToken();
sock.setAccessToken(token);
sock.setWamoAuth(auth, host);

// --- Meta AI memory
await sock.metaAiMemoryQuery();
await sock.metaAiMemoryDelete(memoryId);
await sock.metaAiMemoryDeleteAll();
await sock.metaAiMemoryOptOutStatus();
await sock.metaAiMemoryOptOutUpdate(true);

// --- Imagine (image & video generation)
await sock.imagineIntents("a cat wearing sunglasses");
await sock.imagineEdit(imageId, "make it night time");
await sock.imagineExpand(imageId, "left");
await sock.imagineGenerateAnimate(imageId);
await sock.imagineVideoStatus(jobId);

// --- AI personas
await sock.aiHomeFetchUserCreatedPersonas();
await sock.aiCreationUpdatePersona(botId, updates);
await sock.aiCreationDeletePersona(botId);

// --- Raw executors, for queries not wrapped above
await sock.executeWWWGraphQL(docId, variables, token, dataPath);
await sock.executeFacebookGraphQL(docId, variables, token, dataPath);
await sock.executeWamoGraphQL(docId, variables, wamoAuth, dataPath, wamoHost);

// --- Raw doc ID dictionaries
sock.WWW_GQL_IDS;
sock.FACEBOOK_GQL_IDS;
sock.WAMO_GQL_IDS;
sock.CLIENT_PERSIST_GQL_IDS;
```

> [!WARNING]
> These calls leave the WhatsApp WebSocket and hit Meta's HTTPS endpoints directly. They have no built-in timeout, so wrap them in your own if a hung request would stall your bot.

sock.ev.on("newsletter-settings.update", (update) => {});
sock.ev.on("settings.update", (update) => {});
```

#### 📰 `newsletter.status`

Fires for channel (newsletter) posts pushed by the server, carrying the post content alongside its engagement counters.
```javascript
sock.ev.on("newsletter.status", (update) => {
  console.log("📰 Newsletter post", ":", update);
});

// --- Output
// {
//    id: '120111111111111111@newsletter',
//    messageId: '3A4E0CA0AEF807976D5B',
//    serverId: 42,
//    timestamp: 1785923027,
//    isSender: false,
//    viewsCount: 128,
//    responsesCount: 7,
//    reactionCounts: [
//       { code: '👍', count: 12 }
//    ],
//    meta: {
//       editedAt: 1785923100,
//       originalTimestamp: 1785923027
//    },
//    content: {
//       type: 'text',
//       message: { conversation: 'Hello from the channel!' }
//    }
// }
```

`content.type` is one of `text`, `media` (with an extra `mediaType`), `reaction` (with a `code`), or `revoke`. It is `null` when the stanza carries only counter updates.

#### 📞 `call`

The call event now carries the full signalling payload.
```javascript
sock.ev.on("call", ([call]) => {
  console.log("📞 Call", ":", call);
});
```

| `latencyMs`                 | `status: 'relaylatency'`         | Relay latency                                                |

`status` can also be a specific end-call reason instead of a bare `terminate`: `timeout`, `reject_do_not_disturb`, `mic_permission_denied`, `camera_permission_denied`, `remote_busy`, or `remote_offline`.
